singularity --verbose build --fakeroot r_libs.sif Singularity # success starting from rocker/tidyverse:4.2.2, but need more packages
# CRAN recommends installing r-base, r-base-dev (for install.packages function) and r-recommended (a package bundle with libs such as nnet and nlme)
# installing R packages with missing deps (such as freetype2) on simpler rocker images causes errors, and then image not built
# installing R packages interactively, they are not permanent, but good for testing

# build a basic image, above, and edit it interactively
singularity exec r_libs.sif /bin/bash
singularity exec r_libs.sif bash # file system not loaded rw
singularity shell --no-home --fakeroot --writable r_libs.sif # changes occur in the sandbox only, image doesn't keep the changes; use this to test package additions
singularity shell --no-home r_libs.sif # this also works for interactive use
